I have successfully updated the `BANNED_ITEMS_OPTIONS` in `SingleUsePlastic.jsx` to correct the label to **"Not Mentioned"**.

**Changes Implemented:**
-   **Standardized Label:** Replaced all instances of `"Not Mention"` with `"Not Mentioned"` across all area lists in the dropdown configuration.
-   **Consistency:** This ensures that every area's banned items list now ends with the exact text "Not Mentioned" as per your latest request.

**Code Reference:**
-   `client-react/src/components/PlantProcessSteps/SingleUsePlastic.jsx`
